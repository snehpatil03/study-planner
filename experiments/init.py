"""
Experiment utilities for hyperâ€‘parameter optimisation.

This subpackage provides simple routines for exploring different parameter
settings of the RAG pipeline.  For instance, you can vary the number of
documents retrieved (``k``) or the chunk size used during ingestion and
measure the impact on latency or answer quality.
